build_cache_from_output.py - Builds or rebuilds the uploaded IDs cache

This utility script scans the "output" directory for JSON log files containing attendance logs
that have already been uploaded, extracts their document IDs, and saves them to a cache file.
This helps prevent duplicate uploads by maintaining a reliable record of previously uploaded logs.

Run this script whenever you manually alter log records or need to refresh the cache.
